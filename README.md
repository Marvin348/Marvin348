## Hi there 👋

I’m a motivated career changer from Germany, currently transitioning into Frontend Development.
For the past 9 months I’ve been learning and building projects with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind** and **React** — and I recently started diving into **TypeScript** to strengthen my foundation.

### 🔥 What I enjoy

- Building clean, interactive and user-friendly web interfaces
- Learning modern technologies and applying them in real projects
- Solving problems step by step and improving with every challenge

### 🚀 My Goals

- Join a modern frontend team that works with up-to-date technologies
- Grow into a strong Frontend Developer through real project experience
- Keep expanding my skills while building meaningful products
- **Long-term:** Expand my skills towards **Fullstack Development**

### 📌 Current Focus

- React ecosystem
- TypeScript fundamentals
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code
